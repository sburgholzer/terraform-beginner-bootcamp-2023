## Semantic Versioning

This project is going to utilize semantic versioning for its tagging.
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

The general format:

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, eg. `1.0.1`

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

## Install the Terraform CLI

### Considerations with the Terraform CLI changes
The Terraform CLI installation intructions have changed due to gpg keyring changes. So needed to refer to the latest install CLI instructions via Terraform Documentation and change the scripting for install.

[Install Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

### Considerations for Linux Distribution

This project is built against Ubuntu.
Please consider checking our Linux Distribution and change accordingly to distrubtion needs.

[How to Check OS Version in Linux](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-check-os-version-in-linux-command-line/)

Example of checking OS Version:

```
$ cat /etc/os-release 
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION_ID="22.04"
VERSION="22.04.3 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
VERSION_CODENAME=jammy
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
UBUNTU_CODENAME=jammy
```

### Refactoring into Bash Scripts

While fixing the Terraform CLI gpg depreciation issues noticed that bash scripts steps were a considerable amount more code. So decided to create a bash script to install the Terraform CLI.

This bash script is located here: [./bin/install_terraform_cli.sh](./bin/install_terraform_cli.sh)

- This will keep the Gitpod Task File ([.gitpod.yml](.gitpod.yml)) tidy.
- This allows for an easier debug and excute manually Terraform CLI install.
- This will allow better portability for other projects that need to install Terraform CLI.

#### Shebang Considerations

A Shebang (pronounced Sha-bang) tells the script what program will be interpeting the script. eg. `#!bin/bash`

ChatGPT recomended this format for bash: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`

- for portability for different OS distributions
- will search the user's PATH for the bash executable

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)

#### Execution Considerations
When executing the bash script we can use the `./` shorthad notation to execute the bash script.

eg. `./bin/install_terraform_cli.sh`

If we are using a script in .gitpod.yml we need to point the script to a program to interpert it.

eg. `source ./bin/install_terraform_cli.sh`

##### Linux Permissions Considerations

In order to make our bash scripts executable we need to change Linux permissions for the file to be executable at the user level.

```sh
chmod u+x ./bin/install_terraform_cli.sh
```

alternatively:
```sh
chmod 744 ./bin/install_terraform_cli.sh
```

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod

## GitPod Lifecycle (Before, Init, Command)

We need to be careful when using the Init because it will not rerun if we restart an existing workspace.

https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks


## Working with Env Vars

### env command

We can list out all Enivornment Variables (Env Vars) using the `env` command

We can filter specific env vars using grep eg. `env | grep AWS_`

### Setting and Unsetting Env Vars

In the terminal we can set uisng `export HELLO='world'`

In the terminal we unset using `unset HELLO`

We can set an env var temporarily when just running a command

```sh
HELLO='world' ./bin/print_message
```

Within a bash script we can set env var without writing export eg.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

HELLO ='world'

echo $HELLO
```

### Printing Env Vars

We can print an env var using echo eg. `echo $HELLO`

### Scoping of Env Vars

When you open up new bash terminals in VSCode it will not be aware of env vars that you have set in another window.

If you want Env Vars to persist across all future bash terminals that are open you need to set env vars in your bash profile. eg. `.bash_profile`

### Persisting Env Vars in GitPod

We can persist env vars into GitPod by storing them in GitPod Secrets Storage

```
gp env HELLO='world'
```

All future workspaces launched will set the env vars for all bash terminals opened in those workspaces.

You can also set en vars in the `.gitpod.yml` but this can only contain non-sensitive env vars.

## AWS CLI Installation

AWS CLI is installed for the project via the bash script [`./bin/install_aws_cli.sh`](./bin/install_aws_cli.sh)

[Getting Started Install (AWS CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
[AWS CLI Env Vars](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)

We can check if our AWS credentials is configured correctly by running the following AWS CLI command:

```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

If it is successful you should see a json payload return that looks like this:

```json
{
    "UserId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/terraform-dct"
}
```
We'll need to generate AWS CLI credits from IAM User in order to the user AWS CLI.

## Terraform Basics

### Terraform Registry

Terraform sources their providers and modules from the Terraform registry which is located at [registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io/)

- **Providers** are interfaces to APIs that will allow to create resources in Terraform.
- **Modules** are a way to make large amount of Terraform code modular, portable and sharable.

[Random Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random)

### Terraform Console

We can see a list of all the Terraform commands by simply typing `terraform`

#### Terraform Init
At the start of a new Terraform project we will run `terraform init` to download the binaries for the terraform providers that we'll use in this project.

#### Terraform Plan

`terraform plan`

This will generate out a changeset, about the state of our infrastructure and what will be changed.

We can ouput this changeset ie. "plan" to be passed to an apply, but often you can just ignore outputting.

#### Terraform Apply

`terraform apply`

This will run a plan and pass the changeset to be executed by Terraform. Apply should prompt yes or no.

If we want to automatically approve an apply, we can provide the auto approve flag eg. `terraform apply --auto-approve`

#### Terraform Destroy

`terraform destroy` will destroy the entire infrastructure that Terraform created.

To automatically approve a destroy, we can provide the auto approve flag eg. `terraform apply --auto-approve`

#### Terraform Lock Files

`.terraform.lock.hcl` contains the locked versioning for the providers or modules that should be used with this project.

The Terraform Lock File **should be committed** to your Version Control System (VSC) eg. GitHub.

#### Terraform State Files

`.terraform.tfstate` contains information about the current state of your infrastructure.

This file **should not be commited** to your VCS.

This file can contain sensentive data.

If you lose this file, you lose knowing the state of your infrasturcture.

`.terraform.tfstate.backup` is the previous state file state.

#### Terraform Directory

`terraform` directory contains binaries of Terraform providers.

## Issues with Terraform Cloud Login and Gitpod Workspace

When attempting to run `terraform login` it will launch a wiswig view in bash to generate a token. However it does not work as expected in GitPod VsCode in the browser.

The workaround is to manually generate a token in Terraform Cloud [Terraform Cloud Token](https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens?source=terraform-login)

Then create the file manually here and then open it:

```sh
touch /home/gitpod/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json
open /home/gitpod/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json
```

Provide the following JSON and replace the token with your own token:

```json
{
    "credentials": {
        "app.terraform.io": {
            "token": "YOUR-TERRAFORM-CLOUD-TOKEN"
        }
    }
}
```

We have automated this workaround with the following bash script [./bin/generate_tfrc_credentials.sh](./bin/generate_tfrc_credentials.sh)
