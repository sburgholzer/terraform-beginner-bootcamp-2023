            <p>It was previously announced that Garth would be opening a Bar/Honkytonk downtown Nashville on Broadway. He made sure to build a precinct inside of it for the Nashville Metro Police Department as there are no other close precincts.
                It has recently been announced that a Dive Bar concert for the opening of his "Friends in Low Places Bar & Honky-Tonk" (named after one of his most famous songs "Friends in Low Places") would occur on Black Friday, November 24, 2023.
                This event will be the first opportunity for fans to get into the bar. In order to get tickets is to win them by listening to The Big 615 station on TuneIn.

            <p>For his most recent stadium tour, Garth had his own channel on SiriusXM where he played his songs of course, other country music but also musicians he grew up listening to and current musicions regardless of genre 
                that he enjoys. He ended his channel a little after his stadium tour ended. In 2023 he announced he was launching his own internet only radio station called "The BIG 615" on TuneIn. It is somewhat similar to his SiriusXM station
                but he has live DJs and interviews with musicians on it.
